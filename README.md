# JS-KATA
These are the exercises for the elective.

1. Start by forking this repo to make it your own.

2. The clone it using something like `git clone https://github.com/yourgithubhandle/js-kata.git`

3. See which branches are available `git branch -a`

You'll see a lot of urls, looking like: `remotes/origin/something` we're looking for the "something part"

4. "Track" the remote branch you wish to work with: `git checkout something` (the first time it'll be `git checkout W19Monday`)

5. Now you're ready to actually do this days exercises. Tomorrow you have already forked the repository, so you can go directly to step 3/4 (like `git checkout W19Tuesday`)

## About the exercises
In each branch there'll be a README.md file containing the instructions for the excerise, as well as a solution folder which is where you'll put your solution.

The easy way to read the `.md` file is by going to your repo at github.com


TODO what about changes in the main repo, how will that get propagated to the students forked versions?
