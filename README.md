# JS-KATA
These are the exercises for the elective.

1. Start by forking this repo to make it your own.

2. The clone it using something like `git clone https://github.com/yourgithubhandle/js-kata.git`

3. See which branches are available `git branch -a``
You'll see a lot of urls, looking like: `remotes/origin/something` we're looking for the "something part"

4. "Track" the remote branch you wish to work with: `git checkout something` (the first time it'll be `git checkout W19Monday`)
