### Fun with the speech API
**The site you create MUST run on localhost or https**

Now it's your turn.

### Your task
Look at the following example

1. when the page loads, an element (div?) slides up/in containing the cookie notification
2. When a button is pressed, it slides back out

You do not need to implement cookies (and cookies are horrible to work with in JS).

If you feel like doing a bit more, take a look at a newer alternative to cookies called [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) that's way easier to work with
